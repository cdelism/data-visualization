VISUALIZATION 
We have created two form of visualization that is static maps using map composer tool in QGIS and interactive map (web map) using Leaflet. interactive map available in this link Drainage visualization.

STATIC MAPS
First, we try to visualize what are the major threat toward the drainage blockage in Zanzibar, and we realize Dumping site, water body and poor building plan are major reasons drainage blockage as shown in the maps below.

 



Our next visualization we try to portray type of materials that weakening and influence drainage blockage system in Zanzibar, the result was the solid waste to be a common blockage material type that occupy in most of drainage in Zanzibar as shown into a maps below.

 








Our last visualization look at the impact that could happen if drainage system fail to work as expected, and as you can see it try to give picture on how far does people houses are going to be affected when drainage become block with flooded water.
